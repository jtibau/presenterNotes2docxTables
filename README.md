# presenterNotes2docxTables
This is a small script to help move the presenter notes from a pptx into a docx according to a specific format that I need it in

I got started using the following links:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63659972/extract-presenter-notes-from-pptx-file-powerpoint
- https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Usage
Install python-pptx and python-docx

Run it in the command line and give it the pptx file you need to extract the notes from. It will create a new docx with the same name next to original.
